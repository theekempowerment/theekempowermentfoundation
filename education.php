        <div class="block">
            <h2>What is Basic Literacy?</h2>
            <p>Basic literacy refers to the ability to read, write, and perform basic mathematical calculations. It is the foundation for further learning and enables individuals to function effectively in their everyday lives. Literacy empowers people to engage in their communities, make informed decisions, and pursue opportunities for personal growth. At Theek Youth and Adult Education Center, our literacy programs are designed to help learners of all ages acquire these essential skills.</p>

        <!-- Primary Education -->
        <div class="block">
            <h2>Primary Education</h2>
            <p>Primary education is the first stage of formal education, typically aimed at children between the ages of 6 and 14. It provides the foundation for a child’s academic journey, focusing on basic subjects such as reading, writing, arithmetic, science, and social studies. Primary education plays a crucial role in shaping a child's cognitive, social, and emotional development, preparing them for secondary education and beyond. We offer primary education programs for children and adults who may have missed the opportunity to attend school earlier in life.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Secondary Education -->
        <div class="block">
            <h2>Secondary Education</h2>
            <p>Secondary education follows primary education and usually serves students between the ages of 14 and 18. This level of education builds on the foundation laid in primary school, offering more specialized subjects such as mathematics, languages, sciences, and humanities. Secondary education is critical for preparing students for higher education, vocational training, or entering the workforce. Our center provides flexible secondary education programs, ensuring that both youth and adults can continue their academic journey at their own pace.</p>

        <!-- The 8-4-4 System of Education -->
        <div class="block">
            <h2>The 8-4-4 System of Education</h2>
            <p>The 8-4-4 system is a Kenyan education structure that was introduced in 1985. It represents 8 years of primary education, 4 years of secondary education, and 4 years of university education. Under this system, students begin their formal education in Standard 1 and complete primary school after 8 years. They then proceed to secondary school for 4 years, where they sit for the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examination. After secondary school, students can choose to join a university, college, or pursue vocational training for another 4 years. The 8-4-4 system was designed to emphasize practical skills, self-reliance, and adaptability in a dynamic world.</p>

        <div class="block">
            <h2>Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC)</h2>
            <p>Kenya’s Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) is a new education system designed to replace the 8-4-4 system. CBC focuses on developing learners’ competencies, including critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity, rather than just the memorization of content. It emphasizes learner-centered education, ensuring students can apply their knowledge in real-life situations. The CBC is structured into a 2-6-3-3 system, where learners spend 2 years in pre-primary, 6 years in primary, 3 years in junior secondary, and 3 years in senior secondary. The curriculum aims to nurture every learner’s potential and talent, preparing them for the rapidly changing job market and life challenges.</p>
